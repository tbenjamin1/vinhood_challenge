 ### Front-end project assignment
## Introduction
"Amazing Filter Page" is an application designed to filter and display a catalog of cats on user devices.
The application is structured with the following components:
A single page application, accessible via browser, whose purpose is to apply filters that a user wants to apply on the catalog
A public API, whose purpose is to return a list of cats that can be filtered
In the context of the "Amazing Filter Page" application, you are asked to design a SPA with a filter page similar to the screenshot available in this bundle, and apply the filters to a HTTP REST API request. The list of filters can be based on a public API of your choice. As a minimum requirement, you are required to have at least a multiple choice (multiselect) filter and a range filter.
